There is currently a namespace problem in the CardControl.xaml file: "Error Code XDG0008 - The name "RankNameConverter" does not exist in the namespace                      "clr-namespace:KarliCards.Gui".

The file RankNameConverter.cs does exist in the KarliCards.Gui namespace.

I have read numerous posts on Stack Overflow and other sources about exactly this issue (some dating back to 2012) which would appear to be some sort of bug with Visual Studio and have tried a number of the suggested fixes to no avail.

I have check over the code (all of which is given by the uCertify course) multiple times and cannot find anything wrong with it.
